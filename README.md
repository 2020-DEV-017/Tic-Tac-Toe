# TIC-TAC-TOE

   Two players take turns marking an available cell in 3 X 3 Game board with their respective tokens (either "X" or "O"). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a win.
